# Food-calories-nutrients-detection

AI-powered application that helps users understand what they’re eating — simply by uploading an image of their plate.

It detects and analyzes food items in real-time, calculates total calories and nutrients, compares the intake with the user’s health goals, and then provides smart recommendations:

If you’ve eaten too much, it suggests exercises to burn extra calories.

If you’ve eaten too little, it recommends foods to bridge the gap.

It also includes exercise pose detection to track your real-time workouts, count repetitions, and adjust your calorie balance accordingly.

Whether you're tracking your fitness, managing weight, or just curious about your meal — this app gives you full insight and control, all in an engaging and interactive experience.
